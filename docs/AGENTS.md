# AI Agent Development Guidelines
*Productivity Multiplier: 1 AI Agent Hour = 80 Human Hours*

## Core Philosophy

### Productivity Metrics
- **1 AI Agent Hour = 80 Human Hours**
- All estimates must use this conversion factor
- Focus on high-leverage AI automation
- Prioritize tasks with maximum time-saving potential

### Development Approach
- **Autonomous First**: Build for autonomous operation from day one
- **Single Agent Focus**: One intelligent agent, not distributed systems
- **Real-time Decision Making**: Immediate response to market conditions
- **Continuous Learning**: Agent improves from every trade and market observation

## Working Style Preferences

### Project Management
- **Documentation-Driven**: Everything documented before implementation
- **Phase-Based Development**: Clear phases with measurable outcomes
- **Checkbox Tracking**: Visual progress tracking with checkboxes
- **Iterative Refinement**: Build, test, refine, repeat

### Technical Preferences
- **Simple Architecture**: Avoid over-engineering
- **Local Development**: Start local, deploy when ready
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, card-based interfaces with real-time updates
- **Performance Focus**: Optimize for speed and reliability

### Quality Standards
- **Production-Ready Code**: Every commit should be deployment-ready
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated testing for critical trading logic
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for financial operations
- **Security First**: Secure API handling, especially for trading operations

## Communication Guidelines

### Reporting Style
- **Executive Summary**: Start with high-level outcomes
- **Technical Details**: Follow with implementation specifics  
- **Time Estimates**: Always use 1 AI hr = 80 human hrs conversion
- **Progress Updates**: Regular checkpoint communications

### Decision Making
- **Data-Driven**: Decisions backed by market data and analysis
- **Risk-Aware**: Always consider downside scenarios
- **Efficiency-Focused**: Choose solutions that maximize AI leverage
- **Future-Proof**: Build for scalability without over-engineering

## Implementation Standards

### Code Quality
- **Clean Code**: Readable, maintainable, well-commented
- **Modular Design**: Separate concerns, reusable components
- **API-First**: Design APIs before implementing features
- **Documentation**: Code should be self-documenting with clear docstrings

### Financial Application Requirements
- **Precision**: All financial calculations must be precise
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all trading decisions
- **Risk Controls**: Built-in safeguards and position limits
- **Real-time Performance**: Sub-second response times for trading operations

## Success Metrics

### Development Velocity
- **Feature Completion**: Measured against AI hour estimates
- **Quality Gates**: Zero critical bugs in production
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Response times, accuracy metrics
- **User Experience**: Intuitive, beautiful, responsive interface

### Trading Performance
- **Autonomous Operation**: Hours of unsupervised operation
- **Decision Accuracy**: Percentage of profitable trade decisions
- **Risk Management**: Adherence to position and loss limits
- **Market Responsiveness**: Speed of reaction to market events
