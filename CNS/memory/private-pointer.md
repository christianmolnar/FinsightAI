## Memory Architecture Integration

### Public Memory (Current Location)
This `memory/public/` folder contains:
- Shareable knowledge templates
- General market analysis frameworks
- Public trading methodology examples
- Anonymized performance patterns

### Private Memory (Referenced Location)
The private memory system contains:
- **Episodic Memory**: Actual trading history, specific market events, client interactions
- **Semantic Memory**: Proprietary knowledge, client-specific insights, advanced models
- **Procedural Memory**: Private trading procedures, custom workflows, client protocols
- **Working Memory**: Active analysis, live positions, real-time monitoring

## Memory Synchronization

### Public → Private Flow
- Templates and frameworks from public memory enhance private implementations
- General knowledge patterns inform specific private decisions
- Capability definitions guide private memory organization

### Private → Public Flow
- Anonymized insights enhance public memory templates
- Successful patterns (privacy-protected) improve public frameworks
- Learning outcomes refine public capability definitions

### Bidirectional Learning
- Pattern recognition improvements flow both directions
- Strategy effectiveness insights (anonymized) enhance public knowledge
- Client preference patterns (generalized) improve public templates

## Access Protocol

### Read Operations
- Public CNS components read from both public and private memory
- Private workspace operations primarily use private memory
- Cross-reference lookups maintain consistency

### Write Operations
- Public memory updates through template enhancement
- Private memory updates through operational experience
- Synchronized updates maintain coherence across both systems

### Security Boundaries
- Private memory never exposes sensitive data to public space
- Public memory templates remain generic and shareable
- Cross-references use privacy-preserving abstractions
