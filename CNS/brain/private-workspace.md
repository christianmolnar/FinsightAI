```

## Workspace Structure

### Active Operations (`workspace/`)
- `current-plans.md` - Active trading plans and market strategies
- `trading-strategies/` - Proprietary trading algorithms and methodologies
- `portfolio-data/` - Real account balances, positions, and performance
- `market-analysis/` - Private research, client-specific analysis
- `risk-management/` - Position sizing rules, stop-loss protocols

### Memory Storage (`memory/`)
- `episodic/` - Trading history, successful/failed trades, market events
- `semantic/` - Financial knowledge base, model libraries, frameworks
- `procedural/` - Trading procedures, analysis workflows, client protocols
- `working/` - Current analysis projects, pending trades, monitoring lists

### Agent State (`state/`)
- `current-status.md` - Real-time agent status and active positions
- `future-plans.md` - Development roadmap and strategy evolution
- `metrics.json` - Performance tracking and improvement metrics
- `external-integrations.md` - Links to advanced trading repository

## Integration Points

### Public CNS ↔ Private Workspace
- **Public Brain** defines capabilities and persona
- **Private Workspace** contains actual implementation and data
- **Public Memory** stores templates and general knowledge
- **Private Memory** stores specific experiences and proprietary insights

### Security Boundaries
- No actual financial data in public repository
- No API keys or authentication credentials in public space
- No client-specific information in public documentation
- No proprietary trading strategies in public brain components

### Cross-Reference Protocol
- Public CNS references private workspace for implementation
- Private workspace inherits persona and capabilities from public CNS
- Memory synchronization maintains learning continuity
- State coordination ensures consistent agent behavior

## Access Patterns

### Development Workflow
1. Modify public CNS components for capability changes
2. Update private workspace for operational changes
3. Sync memory between public templates and private experiences
4. Test integration across both repositories

### Operational Workflow
1. Public CNS provides interface and coordination
2. Private workspace executes actual trading operations
3. Results flow back to update both public and private memory
4. Learning insights enhance both capability definitions and implementations

## External Repository Integration

### Advanced Trading Repository
**Status**: Development phase with Coinbase and Schwab integrations
**Location**: `[To be documented when functional]`
**Integration Plan**: Migrate working components to unified private workspace
**Timeline**: Coordinate with Phase 3 of implementation plan

### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Establish CNS structure and basic private workspace
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate stable components from external repository
3. **Phase 3**: Integrate Coinbase and Schwab APIs into private workspace
4. **Phase 4**: Deprecate external repository in favor of unified structure
